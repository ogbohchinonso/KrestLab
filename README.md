# KrestLab — Full-Stack Browser IDE with AI Tutor

A self-hosted, production-ready code editor and learning platform. Write and run HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, Java, C++, Rust, Go, and SQL — all for free — with auth, saved snippets, sharing, and an AI tutor that builds a personalised curriculum, explains every concept, and walks you through a capstone project.

```

- **HTML/CSS/JS** run instantly client-side in a sandboxed `<iframe>` — no server round-trip.
- **Python, Java, C++, Rust, Go, TypeScript, SQL, etc.** run on a **self-hosted Judge0 CE** instance (Docker) — your own execution sandbox, no third-party API key, no rate limit beyond what you set.
- **AI Tutor** calls the DeepSeek API to generate a full multi-step curriculum + capstone project for any topic, explain concepts, give Socratic hints, and review submitted code.

## Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Docker + Docker Compose
- A [DeepSeek API key](https://platform.deepseek.com)

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in:
- `JWT_SECRET` — any long random string
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` — your DeepSeek API key
- `JUDGE0_AUTH_TOKEN` — any string, secures your self-hosted Judge0 instance

### 3. Launch the full stack

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This starts:
- `krestlab-api` on port `4000`
- `krestlab-mongo` (MongoDB) on port `27017`
- `krestlab-judge0` (execution engine) on port `2358`
- Judge0's worker, Postgres, and Redis containers

### 4. Serve the frontend

The frontend is static — no build step. For local dev:

```bash
cd frontend
npx serve .          # or: python3 -m http.server 3000
```

Update `frontend/js/config.js` if your API isn't on `localhost:4000`:

```js
window.KrestConfig = { API_BASE: 'https://api.yourdomain.com/api' };
```

### 5. Open the app

Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or wherever you served the frontend). Register an account, pick a language tab, and hit Run.

## Deploying to production

- **Backend** — deploy the `backend/` folder (with its Dockerfile) to Render, Railway, Fly.io, or a VPS with Docker. Point `MONGO_URI` at a managed MongoDB (Atlas free tier works).
- **Judge0** — either keep it self-hosted alongside your backend (same docker-compose, on a VPS with enough RAM — 2GB+ recommended), or swap `services/judge0.js`'s `JUDGE0_URL` to a managed Judge0 RapidAPI endpoint if you'd rather not maintain the execution sandbox yourself.
- **Frontend** — deploy `frontend/` as static files to Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Cloudflare Pages. Update `config.js` to point at your live API URL.
- **CORS** — set `CLIENT_URL` in your backend `.env` to your deployed frontend's origin.

---

## Monetization hooks already wired (not yet enforced)

Per your direction, **all languages and the AI tutor are free** right now. The codebase still has the scaffolding ready for when you want to monetize differently:

- `User.usage.executions` tracks every execution per user (visible in dashboard later)
- Stripe SDK is installed and `.env` has placeholder keys — no checkout flow built yet
- `Snippet.isPublic` + community browsing (`GET /api/snippets/public`) is built — a natural place for a "featured snippets" or marketplace feature later
- XP/level system (`user.tutor.xp`) is live and could gate advanced curricula, badges, or a leaderboard

Ideas to revisit once you're ready to monetize: a paid "Teams" tier (shared workspaces, private curricula for students you mentor), a marketplace where users sell premium curricula/capstones, or sponsored company "challenge tracks" using your existing public-snippet infrastructure.

---

## Known limitations (intentionally not papered over)

- **Judge0 self-hosted** needs a reasonably resourced host (2GB+ RAM) because it spins up isolated sandboxes per submission. On a small free-tier VPS, expect execution latency.
- **AI-generated curricula** are not human-reviewed. Treat them as a strong first draft, not a vetted syllabus — useful for your stated goal of personalised, on-demand learning paths, but worth spot-checking for accuracy on advanced topics.
- **DeepSeek JSON reliability**: the curriculum generator asks the model to return strict JSON. DeepSeek is occasionally less consistent at this than Claude on long, structured prompts — `tutor.js` already catches parse failures gracefully, but if you see frequent "Failed to parse curriculum" errors, that's why. Worth retrying the request, or switching `DEEPSEEK_MODEL` to a newer DeepSeek release if one becomes available.
